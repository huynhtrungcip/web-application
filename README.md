# Web Application Security Analysis

Welcome to the **Web Application** repository! This project is dedicated to analyzing and demonstrating common vulnerabilities in web applications, with a primary focus on the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## ✨ Overview
This repository is built to help learners, developers, and security enthusiasts understand how critical security flaws work and how to prevent them in real-world applications. 

The analysis includes code samples, write-ups, and hands-on labs related to the following:
- Injection Attacks (SQL, Command, etc.)
- Broken Authentication
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- XML External Entities (XXE)
- Broken Access Control
- Security Misconfiguration
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Deserialization
- Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
